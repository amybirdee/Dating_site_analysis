- This dataset contains around 60,000 rows of data consisting of the profiles of dating site members over the 2011-2012 period

- This project aims to discover patterns, trends and insights in the member data

- Following data cleaning and exploration, the data will be modelled using a clustering algorithm to further discover patterns in the data

- The project is still a work in progress and is mainly being carried out in Python with a smaller part of the analysis done in SQL

- Two jupyter notebook have been uploaded so far and more will follow in due course along with a final presentation
