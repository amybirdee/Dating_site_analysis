# Analysing the profiles of members of the OkCupid dating site

- The data consist of circa 60,000 profiles on OkCupidâ€™s member database during the 2011-2012 period

- This project aims to segment the data and discover patterns in the member profiles, e.g. what is the age profile of members? What are their eating and drinking habits? Is there a link between their level of education and drug use? Are they even single??

- The main findings in the data have been presented in graphical format and the data analysis has been carried out in Python

- The Python libraries used include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

- For a detailed description of the code, feel free to read my article on www.data36.com. Links to parts 1 and 2 are below:
